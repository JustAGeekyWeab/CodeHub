# Rock Paper Scissors 

* R1 - Not even anything. Just basic version to check for Int inputs
* R2 - Can do a small game but no adaptive AI.
* R3 - Adaptive AI basics only
* R4 - Combines both but has a wonky section in regards to treating probability and comparing.
* R5 - Accurately adapts based on the choices of high, medium, or low and accurately tracks what you input.
* R6 - Now uses rock paper scissors and keeps track of all the times you picked.

* RPS2 - A more refined version on my return

* GetRoll - Supposed to calculate the rolls but needs to adress the count adding
