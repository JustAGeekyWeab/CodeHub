# Rock Paper Scissors 

* R1 - Not even anything. Just basic version to check for Int inputs
* R2 - Can do a small game but no adaptive AI.
* R3 - Adaptive AI basics only
* R4 - Combines both but has a wonky section in regards to treating probability and comparing.
* R5 - Will combine everything. WIP
